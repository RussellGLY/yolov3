CVAT setup instructions:

This worked for me on my Mac. It should also work on an EC2 instance if you prefer.

1. Follow the instructions on this page: https://github.com/opencv/cvat/blob/master/cvat/apps/documentation/installation.md

2. On CVAT, create a new task. For the labels, copy/paste the attached file.

3. Attach the training video and click submit. This will take 15 minutes or so.

4. From the actions menu, select 'upload annotations' and upload the annotations file for the video.

5. Verify the annotations uploaded by viewing them within the video. You should be able to see the boxes drawn on each frame and the labels.

6. From the actions menu, export your training set in the desired format (yolo, COCO, VOC, etc.). This will take an hour or so.
